I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back.
I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet,
and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed
at the usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to
dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around.

The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only
like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and
poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before
I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some
leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured;
that was all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids.
